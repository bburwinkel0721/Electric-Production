# Project Title: Electricity Production

## Team Members: Rachel, Luke, Victor, and Ben

## Project Description/Outline:
- Using the electric production data set found on Kaggle, the latitudes/longitudes of each country involved from Geoapify, and the population data of each country found on the API Ninjas, our group would like to explore the electricity production of countries around the world to see what kind of trends and relationships we can identify. We are also particularly interested in how the United States compares to the rest of the world regarding our electricity production. 
## Research Questions:
- How does the United States compare to other countries in terms of electricity production?
- How does population impact electricity production?
- How do the ratios of fossil fuel vs renewables for electricity compare in countries?
- What do we predict the future fossil fuel to renewable ratio will look like for the U.S.?
## Datasets and APIs Used:
- Electricity Production Dataset from Kaggle.com: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sazidthe1/global-electricity-production
- Geoapify API: https://apidocs.geoapify.com/
- Country Information API: https://api-ninjas.com/api/country

# Limitations:
1. The dataset we used is limited to 45 countries. Our graphs and/or analysis may be different if we were able to see all countries in the world.
2. The current dataset ranges between the years of 2010 to 2023, our analysis would be more confident and accurate if we had more years to pull data from
3. Some of the countries in the dataset do not have data extending back as far as others. This could make it harder to compare all of the countries against one another.
